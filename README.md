# TechWay Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes helpdesk tickets to enhance understanding of common issues, response times, and overall efficiency. It includes three datasets:

1. **TechWay-AnalysedWork.xlsx** - Analysis of helpdesk tickets.
2. **raw_data/helpdesk_tickets.xlsx** - Raw helpdesk ticket data.
3. **raw_data/Ticket and Date Created List.xlsx** - Ticket IDs with creation dates.

## Files Description

### 1. TechWay-AnalysedWork.xlsx
This file contains the results of our detailed analysis after proper data cleaning:
- Summary statistics of ticket counts and resolution times.
- Trends analysis for ticket creation and resolution.
- Performance metrics: response times and SLA compliance.
- Common issues reported by users.

### 2. raw_data/helpdesk_tickets.xlsx
- Ticket ID: Unique identifier.
- Issue Description: Detailed report.
- Resolution: Solution provided.
- Created Date: Timestamp of creation.

## Data Cleaning
We conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis:
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- Handled missing values appropriately.
- Standardized date formats and ticket categories.
- Verified data consistency across datasets.

The results of this clean and processed data are found in **TechWay-AnalysedWork.xlsx**.
